Frameworks
==========

This project is a kit for building a set of relocatable signed frameworks
suitable for inserting into an application bundle which uses python for
the main program.  The frameworks include Python.framework, as well as
frameworks needed for basic python extensions based on external libraries.
These include Readline.framework, Tcl.framework, Tk.framework, OpenSSL.framework,
and ZLib.framework.  The current version of Python used here is 3.10.
